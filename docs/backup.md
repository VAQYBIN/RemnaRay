# Backups and restore

Section 20.5. The `backup` service runs in every profile and takes one dump a
day; `NFR-014` sets the targets it is built for: **RPO 24 hours, RTO 30
minutes**.

## What is kept

| File                            | What                                            |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `remnaray-<yyyymmdd-HHMM>.dump` | `pg_dump -Fc -Z 6` of the whole database        |
| `remnaray-weekly-<stamp>.dump`  | a hard link made on Sundays, for the 8 weeklies |
| `files-<stamp>.tar.gz`          | `themes/` and `uploads/`                        |
| `.last-status`                  | one line: state, time, file, size               |
| `pre-migrate-<version>.dump`    | written by `migrate`; see below                 |

`.env` is never copied. It holds `RR_APP_KEY`, and a backup that carries both
the ciphertext and the key protects nothing — the README asks you to keep it
somewhere else.

Valkey is not backed up either: sessions and queues rebuild themselves. People
sign in again, the cron regenerates the scans, and unfinished `outbox_jobs`
live in PostgreSQL.

## Retention

Fourteen daily dumps and eight weekly ones. The weekly copy is a hard link, so
a Sunday costs no extra space and the two retentions never argue over the same
file: the daily rule prunes `remnaray-<stamp>.dump`, the weekly rule prunes
`remnaray-weekly-<stamp>.dump`, and the bytes go only when the last name does.

`docker compose exec backup /scripts/backup-entrypoint.sh once` takes one now,
and `… rotate` applies the retention without taking one.

## S3

Set `RR_BACKUP_S3_ENDPOINT` and `RR_BACKUP_S3_BUCKET` — and the keys, and
optionally `RR_BACKUP_S3_PREFIX` — and each dump is copied with the MinIO
client after it is written. With the variables unset the step is skipped
silently; the local copy is the same either way. A failed upload does not fail
the backup, because a dump on disk is better than no dump at all, and it is
logged.

## Restore

```sh
./deploy/backup/restore.sh backups/remnaray-20260920-0300.dump
```

It performs the section 20.5 sequence — stop the stack, start PostgreSQL
alone, `pg_restore --clean --if-exists`, start the stack — and asks for
confirmation first, because `--clean` drops what is there now. Set
`RR_RESTORE_ASSUME_YES=true` to skip the prompt in a script.

- It restores as the database user and into the database PostgreSQL itself was
  given (`POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_DB` in `.env`), whatever the shell has.
- When `files-<stamp>.tar.gz` of the same stamp lies next to the dump, it
  restores `themes/` and the `uploads` volume from it too; files the archive
  does not name are kept. A pre-migrate dump has no such archive, and the
  files are then left as they are.
- It waits for PostgreSQL over TCP, so it also works on an empty data volume
  (acceptance 26.4 R3 removes it first).

## The pre-migrate dump

Section 20.4: the `migrate` service applies migrations before `api`, `bot` and
`worker` start. When a pending migration is marked `-- reversible: no` in its
header, it takes `backups/pre-migrate-<RR_VERSION>.dump` first, so a rollback
has something to go back to. `RR_AUTO_PREMIGRATE_BACKUP=false` turns that off.

A fresh database is not dumped: there is nothing in it yet.

## Checking it

`maintenance.backup-check` reads `.last-status` and raises the `backup.failed`
alert when the newest backup is older than 26 hours or the last run failed.
