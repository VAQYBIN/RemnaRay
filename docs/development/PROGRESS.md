# RemnaRay Development Progress

## Current milestone

M0

## Current task

TASK-M0-003 — Caddy image and proxy plugin verification.

## Completed tasks

- TASK-M0-001 — initialized the pnpm/Turborepo monorepo, TypeScript 7.0.2
  compiler setup, ESLint 10 flat config, Prettier, Husky, lint-staged,
  commitlint, Changesets, and empty application/package shells.

- TASK-M0-002 — pinned the section 6.1 JavaScript dependency matrix across
  the root, applications, and workspace packages; fixed `@types/node` at
  `~24.13.6`; added Renovate 24.6 policy groups, release-age windows,
  security bypasses, and major-version exceptions.

## Verification

TASK-M0-001 verified on 2026-09-19:

- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` passed with pnpm 11.26.0.
- `pnpm test` passed: 3 repository tooling checks.
- `pnpm lint` passed with ESLint 10.10.0.
- `pnpm typecheck` passed with TypeScript 7.0.2.
- `pnpm format` passed with Prettier 3.9.8.

The supported execution environment is available: Node.js 24.21.0, pnpm
11.26.0, Docker 29.7.2, and Docker Compose v5.5.0. The initial WSL2/Docker
blocker is resolved.

## Important decisions

- The root compiler remains TypeScript 7.0.2 as required by section 6.1.
- Current `typescript-eslint` 8.70.0 rejects TypeScript 7.0.2. The shared
  `@remnaray/eslint-config` package therefore runs its parser tooling with a
  local TypeScript 6.0.3 dependency, following RISK-001's tool-only fallback;
  application code still uses the root TypeScript 7 compiler.
- `@eslint/js` is pinned to its current ESLint 10 companion version 10.0.1;
  the specification's 10.10.0 pin applies to `eslint` itself.
- pnpm added `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` entries for the pinned Turborepo,
  Node types, and intl-messageformat packages while generating the lockfile;
  these are retained so frozen installs remain reproducible with pnpm 11.26.0.
- pnpm build scripts are explicitly allowlisted in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`;
  telemetry and unused optional builds are denied. The optional native
  `cpu-features` build can report a network failure without failing install.
- Renovate validation uses the official validator; the policy keeps major
  updates behind approval, delays ordinary updates, and allows patch
  automerge only for development dependencies outside sensitive packages.

## Definition of Done review

- Section 25.9: tooling acceptance checks, tests, documentation and Changeset
  are present. No application FR, locales, OpenAPI, migration or secret
  handling changed in this infrastructure task.
- Maintainer review and hosted CI/proxy-smoke remain external gates; CI and
  proxy applications are scheduled later in M0 and are not claimed as passed.
- TASK-M0-002 acceptance checks passed: frozen install, `pnpm ls --depth 0`,
  five tests, lint, typecheck, formatting, and Renovate config validation.

## Known blockers

None. The corrected Git policy allows staging and commits. Nested
`node_modules/` remain ignored, and the handoff file is tracked.

## Next

TASK-M0-003 — verify the current Caddy 2.x patch and implement
`deploy/proxy/caddy` with the caddy-ratelimit plugin.
