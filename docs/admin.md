# Administration authentication

The admin API uses a separate `rr_asid` cookie with a 12-hour lifetime. A
password login creates a five-minute challenge, and the challenge is completed
with a six-digit TOTP. First-time admins use `POST /api/admin/v1/auth/totp/setup`
and then confirm the generated code; subsequent logins use
`POST /api/admin/v1/auth/totp`.

Mutating admin requests must include the CSRF token returned by
`GET /api/admin/v1/auth/me` in `X-CSRF-Token`, alongside the existing
same-origin request headers. Passwords use Argon2id with 64 MiB memory, three
passes, and one thread. Five failed passwords lock the account for 15 minutes;
later lockouts grow exponentially up to 24 hours.

The shared RBAC matrix lives in `packages/domain/src/rbac.ts`. Operators receive
operational permissions only; administration, settings, secret-bearing
integrations, balance debits, and anonymization remain admin-only.

Every authenticated admin mutation produces an immutable `audit_log` row. The
interceptor masks password, token, secret, cookie, authorization, TOTP, and API
key fields before writing `before` or `after` values and truncates oversized
objects.

## Administrators (FR-143)

`GET/POST /api/admin/v1/admins`, `PATCH /api/admin/v1/admins/:id`,
`POST /api/admin/v1/admins/:id/reset-password`, `.../reset-totp` and
`.../deactivate` manage administrator accounts. Only the `admin` role may call
them.

The last active `admin` cannot be deactivated or demoted to `operator`: the
request answers `409 LAST_ADMIN`. The check runs inside the same transaction as
the update and locks the remaining admin rows with `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`, so two
concurrent requests cannot each see the other as the survivor.

`reset-totp` clears the stored secret and the `totp_enabled` flag, so the next
login runs the first-login enrolment again. New and reset passwords require at
least twelve characters with a lowercase letter, an uppercase letter and a
digit.

## SSH recovery

If the setup email was mistyped, the password was forgotten, or the
authenticator is unavailable, recover the account from the deployment checkout
over SSH. These commands update only the selected administrator and keep the
PostgreSQL and Valkey data intact.

First list the actual administrator email and account state:

```sh
./scripts/rr admin:list
```

If the password is unknown, reset it. The command also clears the failed-login
counter and any temporary lock:

```sh
./scripts/rr admin:reset-password
```

Enter the email exactly as shown by `admin:list`, then enter a password of at
least twelve characters containing a lowercase letter, an uppercase letter and
a digit. The password is read without echo and is not stored in the audit log.

If the password is known but the TOTP application or secret is unavailable:

```sh
./scripts/rr admin:reset-totp
```

After the next password login, the setup flow displays a new QR code. Register
it in the authenticator and confirm its six-digit code. Resetting TOTP invalidates
the previous TOTP secret; do not run it when the existing authenticator still
works.

The recovery commands create an audit row with a `system` actor and the action
`admins.recovery.reset-password` or `admins.recovery.reset-totp`. They never
write the password or TOTP secret to the database log. Do not use `down -v` or
delete PostgreSQL volumes during recovery.

## Audit contract

Handlers that change state return `Audited(before, after, body?)`. The
interceptor stores the state the handler read _before_ the change, stores the
resulting state, and answers the HTTP request with `body` (defaulting to
`after`). The request body is never stored as `before`; only its `reason` field
is copied into the audit row.

## Session and challenge handling

- The password failure counter is incremented by the database, so parallel
  attempts cannot overwrite each other and the fifth failure always locks.
- The TOTP enrolment secret is encrypted with `RR_APP_KEY` before it is written
  to Valkey, exactly like the stored secret.
- Deleting the login challenge is the atomic commit point for issuing a session:
  only the request whose `DEL` removed the key receives `rr_asid`, so a replayed
  code cannot mint a second session.
- CSRF applies to `/api/admin/v1/auth/*` as well. Login and TOTP requests have no
  session yet, so they are checked by origin and `X-Requested-With`; once a
  session exists, `X-CSRF-Token` is also required.

## Console

`/admin` is served without a locale prefix and always uses the neutral `_admin`
theme; its texts come from the shipped `admin.json` only, which section 18.4
keeps outside the owner's override surface. The interface language follows
`settings.locale.default` until an administrator profile language exists.

| Path                                | Content                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/admin/login`                      | email + password → TOTP, with first-login enrolment and a QR code     |
| `/admin`                            | FR-142 widgets, revenue and registration charts, "requires attention" |
| `/admin/users`, `/admin/users/[id]` | FR-140 search and filters; FR-141 actions behind reason modals        |
| `/admin/subscriptions`              | Status, plan and expiry filters; bulk extension up to 500 rows        |
| `/admin/payments`                   | Invoices with masked provider events, recheck, transactions, refund   |
| `/admin/plans`                      | FR-145 CRUD with ordering                                             |

`AdminShell` loads `GET /api/admin/v1/auth/me` once, keeps the CSRF token for
later mutations and hides every section the role does not carry. Server-side,
`@Roles`/`@Permissions` enforce the same matrix, so hiding a control is a
convenience rather than the boundary.

## Dashboard aggregates

Every FR-142 number is a SQL aggregate over `transactions`, `subscriptions`,
`users` and `accounts`, cached in Valkey for 60 seconds. Revenue counts
`purchase` and `topup` minus `refund`; the trial conversion is a cohort by trial
date. `test/m4.admin.integration.test.mjs` re-computes each aggregate with an
independent SQL control on fixtures (AC-142) and also covers AC-140 search and
AC-141 audited actions.

## Operator limits

`settings.operator.max_credit_minor` caps an operator's daily total credit and
`settings.operator.max_refund_minor` caps a single refund. An operator can never
debit a balance, run a bulk extension, anonymize a user or edit plans.

## Settings, providers and system (TASK-M4-009)

`/admin/settings` renders the store settings from `GET /settings/schema`, and the
tabs for providers, theme, locales and legal texts. `/admin/admins`,
`/admin/audit` and `/admin/system` complete the section 14.1 list.

### AC-061 — a provider is offered only after a successful healthcheck

`GET /api/admin/v1/providers` reports `offeredToUsers`, which is
`enabled && lastHealthcheckOk === true`. `GET /api/v1/me/payment-methods` uses
the same rule, so a provider that has never been checked, or whose last check
failed, is never offered. Saving a provider configuration runs a healthcheck
immediately, and the console has an explicit «Проверить» action.

### AC-181 — an override reaches the surfaces in time

`PUT /settings` publishes the section 17.6 channels for the keys that changed
(`rr:bot.reconfigure`, `rr:proxy.reload`, `rr:theme.changed`, `rr:i18n.changed`)
and answers with `applied`, `restartRequired` and `reconfigured`. The site
revalidates config, catalogs and theme every five seconds; the bot caches
catalogs for sixty seconds and drops them immediately on `rr:i18n.changed`.

### AC-146 — system page

`GET /api/admin/v1/system` reports the application version, image tags, the last
panel reconciliation, the unpublished outbox depth, the database size, the bot
mode, TLS and backup markers and the health endpoint. `GET /system/queues` gives
waiting/active/failed/delayed per queue and `POST
/system/queues/:name/retry-failed` re-queues failures.

### Journal

`GET /api/admin/v1/audit` filters by actor, action, entity and period. An
operator is restricted to their own rows by the RBAC matrix, and the response
says which scope it returned.

### Locales and legal texts

`GET/PUT /api/admin/v1/i18n/:lang/:namespace` lists the shipped default next to
the active override and applies a patch where `null` clears an override. Every
value is compiled as ICU before it is stored. `GET/PUT
/api/admin/v1/i18n/legal/:doc/:lang` edits a legal document as a whole. Both
invalidate the catalogs, so the site and bot pick the change up inside their
windows.
