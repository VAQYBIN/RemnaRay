# End-to-end tests

`pnpm test:e2e` builds the workspace and runs Playwright against a real stack.

## What the harness starts

`e2e/setup/stack.mjs` brings up, for the whole run:

- PostgreSQL 18 and Valkey 9.1 in Testcontainers;
- `apps/api` from `dist`, against those containers;
- `apps/web` from its standalone build, pointed at the API;
- a minimal reverse proxy that routes `/api` and `/webhooks` to the API and
  everything else to `web`, so the browser sees the single origin it sees behind
  nginx or Caddy in a deployment.

It then seeds the fixtures the specs use: an administrator with a known password
and TOTP secret, one public plan, an enabled and healthy `mock` provider, brand
and bot settings, and one customer with a balance. The resolved URLs and
fixtures are written to `e2e/.stack.json`, which the specs read.

## What the specs cover

| Spec                  | Covers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `site.spec.ts`        | landing brand, plans and CTAs; language switch; legal pages; robots and sitemap; `public/config`, `public/theme`, `public/plans`; the `/r/<code>` referral cookie                                                                                                                      |
| `account.spec.ts`     | the middleware redirect for an anonymous visitor; `/auth/tg` sign-in from the bot; the empty subscription state; the plan list with providers and the promo field; balance and history; saving settings; sign-out; a purchase with the `mock` provider confirmed by its signed webhook |
| `admin-login.spec.ts` | a wrong password; the password + TOTP flow; the redirect of an anonymous visitor to the login screen                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `admin.spec.ts`       | the dashboard widgets and charts; user search and the card; the journal; creating a plan; the AC-061 provider gate; the system page; a forged mutation and one with a wrong CSRF token; `Disallow: /admin`                                                                             |

## Projects

A TOTP code may be redeemed once, so the suite signs in as the administrator
exactly once, in the `setup` project (`e2e/setup/admin-auth.setup.ts`), and
stores the session in `e2e/.auth/admin.json`. The `admin` project depends on
`setup` and reuses that `storageState`; the `public` project runs
unauthenticated and contains the sign-in specs themselves.

## Running locally

The browser needs the usual Chromium system libraries. `pnpm exec playwright
install --with-deps chromium` installs both, and needs root for the system
packages — which is what CI does. Without root, download the libraries into a
prefix and point the loader at it:

```sh
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
apt-get download libnss3 libnspr4 libasound2t64
dpkg-deb -x libnss3_*.deb ./pw-libs   # and the other two
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/pw-libs/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu pnpm test:e2e
```

## Lighthouse (NFR-010)

`pnpm lighthouse` measures the acceptance gate of section 13.2: performance at
least 90, accessibility at least 90 and SEO at least 95 for the landing, and
accessibility at least 90 for the account. It reuses the same stack, so the
numbers describe the production build rather than `next dev`, and audits three
pages with the official desktop preset:

| Target       | Entry                  | Categories                      |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `landing-ru` | `/ru`                  | performance, accessibility, SEO |
| `landing-en` | `/en`                  | performance, accessibility, SEO |
| `account`    | `/auth/tg?token=<jwt>` | accessibility                   |

Lighthouse clears storage before it navigates, so the account audit signs in
the way the bot's «Открыть кабинет» button does instead of presenting a
cookie, and the run fails if the navigation does not end on `/<locale>/account`.
Reports are written to `test-results/lighthouse/<target>.json`.

The browser is resolved from `CHROME_PATH`, falling back to Playwright's
Chromium, so the loader-prefix workaround above also covers this command:

```sh
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/pw-libs/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu \
  CHROME_PATH=$(pnpm exec node -e "console.log(require('@playwright/test').chromium.executablePath())") \
  pnpm lighthouse
```

The remaining accessibility deduction is `color-contrast`: the Manta teal and
white brand pairing the v1 specification fixes reaches 3.03:1, which
`theme-validate` reports as a warning for the same reason (see
`docs/theming.md`). Everything else scores clean, so the landing and the
account sit at 96.

## CI

The `e2e` job runs after `quality`, installs Chromium with its dependencies and
typechecks the suite (`pnpm typecheck:e2e`) and runs `pnpm test:e2e`; a failed
run uploads `test-results` as an artifact. The `lighthouse` job runs the same
way and always uploads `test-results/lighthouse`.
