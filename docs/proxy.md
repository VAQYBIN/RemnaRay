# The proxy profiles

RemnaRay ships its own reverse proxy so the owner never writes a proxy
configuration. `RR_PROXY_PROFILE` chooses one of `nginx` (the default),
`caddy` or `external`, and `./rr up` starts exactly that set of containers
(section 21.1).

## How a configuration reaches nginx

```
settings.domain.* ─┐
settings.admin.ip_allowlist ─┼─► proxy-config ──► proxy-conf volume ──► proxy-nginx
.env ─┘                 (render-proxy.js)        │
                                                 └─► rr:proxy.reload ──► proxy-reloader
```

- `proxy-config` runs `dist/tools/render-proxy.js --watch`. It renders
  `deploy/proxy/<profile>` into the shared `proxy-conf` volume, writing each
  file to a `.tmp` name and renaming it, so nginx never reads a half-written
  file. It publishes `rr:proxy.reload` only when the output actually changed.
- `proxy-reloader` is the only container with the docker socket, mounted
  read-only. On `rr:proxy.reload` it runs `nginx -t` inside `proxy-nginx` and
  reloads only if that passes, so a broken render never takes the site down.
  One reload runs at a time; a request that arrives during it is applied
  right after it, and any number of them make one more reload.
  Every outcome is reported to `POST /api/internal/v1/system/proxy-reload-result`,
  which writes `audit_log(action=proxy.reload)` and raises the
  `proxy.config_invalid` alert on a refusal. A report the API refuses — it
  answers `503` to every internal call until the setup wizard finishes, and
  the wizard's domain step is what reloads — is kept and sent again every 30 s
  and before the next one, until recorded.
- certbot's `--deploy-hook` updates the root-owned certificate list in the
  separate `certbot-state` volume and touches `/run/remnaray/certbot/.renewed`;
  the reloader watches that marker and reloads gracefully after a renewal.

## Templates

`deploy/proxy/nginx/` holds the whole configuration:

| File                       | Rendered as         | Notes                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `nginx.conf.tmpl`          | `nginx.conf`        | the main file; nginx is started with `-c` on it  |
| `site.conf.tmpl`           | `site.conf`         | the `:80` redirect and the `:443` shop           |
| `site-bootstrap.conf.tmpl` | `site.conf`         | HTTP only, while certbot has no certificate yet  |
| `tls-<mode>.inc.tmpl`      | `tls-<mode>.inc`    | http-level TLS setup; only `acme` needs anything |
| `tls-cert-<mode>.inc.tmpl` | `tls-cert.inc`      | the certificate directives of the active mode    |
| `ratelimits.inc`           | copied              | the section 19.2 zones                           |
| `security-headers.inc`     | copied              | the section 19 response headers                  |
| `common-proxy.inc`         | copied              | the upstream headers and timeouts                |
| `custom.d/*.conf`          | copied, never wiped | the owner's single extension point               |

`security-headers.inc` uses nginx's `add_header_inherit merge` so the shared
headers remain on nested locations that add their own cache or content headers.
This covers static Next.js assets, theme assets, `/healthz` and error responses
as well as the main HTML pages. The web image disables Next.js's
`X-Powered-By` response header, and the `rr_lang` locale cookie is marked
`Secure` when the language is changed.

Placeholders are `{{NAME}}` and nothing else is interpreted: `DOMAIN`,
`EXTRA_DOMAINS`, `ACME_EMAIL`, `TLS_MODE`, `DOCKER_CIDR`, `ADMIN_ALLOWLIST`,
`ADMIN_ALLOWLIST_BLOCK`, `API_DOCS_BLOCK`, `INTERNAL_API_BLOCK`,
`LOAD_MODULE_BLOCK`, `EXTRA_DOMAINS_SUFFIX` and `EXTRA_DOMAINS_SERVER`.

`/api/internal/*` is the API of the bot and the worker (section 9.5), which
reach `api:3000` on the compose network. Both profiles answer it themselves
with `404`, and so does the `edge` of the external profile. Only the section
22.7 smoke stand, which sets `RR_ECHO_HEADERS=true` on `proxy-config`, routes
it, for the header echo of step 5 and the browser suite's sign-in. In the
Caddy profile this and the `/api/docs` denial are `handle` blocks: a bare
`respond` is ordered after `handle`, so `handle /api/*` would answer first.

The `extra_domains` redirect server is emitted only when there are extra
domains: an empty `server_name` would make nginx redirect every unmatched host.
The administration allowlist and the `/api/docs` denial are emitted only when
they apply, so an empty setting leaves no stray `deny all;` behind.

## TLS modes

| `RR_TLS_MODE` | Certificate                                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `acme`        | `nginx-module-acme` issues and renews it over HTTP-01   |
| `certbot`     | the `certbot` container, files under `/etc/letsencrypt` |
| `custom`      | the owner's files in `deploy/proxy/certs/`              |
| `none`        | `external` profile only; RemnaRay terminates no TLS     |

`acme` is the default. `load_module modules/ngx_http_acme_module.so;` is
rendered only for that mode, so the other two run on a stock nginx. OCSP
stapling is enabled for `certbot` only: the ACME module serves the certificate
through variables, which stapling does not support, and a `custom` certificate
may be self-signed.

## The Caddy profile

`RR_PROXY_PROFILE=caddy` renders `deploy/proxy/caddy/Caddyfile.tmpl` into the
same `proxy-conf` volume, and `proxy-reloader` applies it with
`caddy reload --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile --adapter caddyfile`. Section 21.5
requires the two profiles to be indistinguishable from outside: the same paths,
the same statuses, the same security headers, the same `405` on a non-POST
webhook and the same `403` on `/metrics` from outside the compose network.

Caddy issues and renews its own certificates, so only two TLS modes apply.
`acme` is the default and needs no configuration; `custom` renders
`tls /certs/fullchain.pem /certs/privkey.pem` from the same
`deploy/proxy/certs/` directory the nginx profile uses. Section 21.4 writes
that path as `/etc/caddy/certs`, but `/etc/caddy` is the read-only `proxy-conf`
volume and Docker cannot create a mount point inside it, so the directory is
mounted at `/certs` instead. `certbot` has no
meaning here and the renderer refuses it rather than emit something that would
silently not work.

`ghcr.io/remnaray/caddy` is `caddy:2.11.4-alpine` rebuilt with
`github.com/mholt/caddy-ratelimit`, because the official image has no
rate-limit module. The five zones carry the nginx numbers: `rr_webhooks`
300/10s, `rr_auth` 5/1m, `rr_admin` 30/1m, `rr_api` 100/10s and `rr_general`
200/10s. An owner who sets `RR_CADDY_IMAGE=caddy:2-alpine` gets a Caddyfile
with no `rate_limit` blocks — the documented degradation of section 21.4, with
the limits left to `@nestjs/throttler`. `GET /api/admin/v1/system` reports it
as `proxy.rateLimited: false` so the administration console can say so.

`custom.d/*.caddy` is the extension point, imported at the end of the site
block exactly as `custom.d/*.conf` is in the nginx profile.

## The image

`deploy/proxy/nginx/Dockerfile` is `nginx:1.30-alpine` plus
`nginx-module-acme`, both pinned. The module is published only by nginx.org and
only for the exact nginx patch it was built against, so a base image that moves
ahead of the module fails the build in CI rather than on the owner's server.
The base image already carries nginx.org's signing key.

## Tests

`pnpm test:m5` builds the image, asserts the module is in it, renders the
configuration for `acme`, `certbot` and `custom` and runs `nginx -t` on each,
then changes `settings.domain.main` and measures the time until the rendered
configuration carries the new domain and the reloader has reported a successful
apply — the section 25.6 budget is fifteen seconds. `nginx -t` loads the
certificate files, so the test mounts a throwaway self-signed pair for the two
modes that name real paths.

It then builds the Caddy image, asserts the rate-limit module is in it, renders
`acme`, `custom` and a stock-image variant, and runs `caddy validate` on each —
`caddy validate` loads the certificate files too, so `custom` gets the same
throwaway pair. It also asserts that `certbot` is refused for the profile.

`apps/api/src/tools/proxy-render.test.ts` covers the rendering itself:
placeholder substitution, the per-mode file set, the bootstrap configuration,
the conditional blocks, the Caddy zones and the atomic write.

## The smoke run: both profiles answer the same

Section 21.5 says the only difference between the profiles is which containers
run. `deploy/ci/proxy-smoke.sh <nginx|caddy>` is what makes that a fact:

```sh
deploy/ci/proxy-smoke.sh nginx
deploy/ci/proxy-smoke.sh caddy
```

It builds a stand from `compose.yaml` plus `deploy/ci/compose.smoke.yaml`, with
a self-signed certificate for `rr.test` (`RR_TLS_MODE=custom` — ACME has no
public domain to answer for on a runner), seeds the section 22.3 fixture with
`dist/tools/seed-dev.js`, and then runs the ten checks of section 22.7:
`/healthz`, the whole path table, the security headers, the upstream echo,
compression, HTTP/2, the HTTP redirect, the reload, and the browser suite.

The expected statuses are a file rather than assertions in the script:

```
# vantage	method	path	status	why
outside	GET	/webhooks/mock	405	webhooks are POST only
outside	GET	/metrics	403	not reachable from outside the compose network
```

`deploy/ci/expected-status.tsv` is read by both profiles, so a divergence is a
failed row and not two scripts that disagree.

**The vantage matters.** A request from the host to a published port is
translated to the compose gateway, which is inside `RR_TRUSTED_PROXIES` — so a
`/metrics` check made from the host would pass without proving anything. The
overlay puts the proxy on a second network, `rr_edge`, and the `outside`
requests come from there.

The stand refuses to start if a `.env` is already present, because it writes
its own, and it removes the stand and that file when it finishes.
`RR_SMOKE_KEEP=true` leaves both in place to look at.

Section 26.4 X2 runs the same script against a live deployment:

```sh
RR_SMOKE_NO_STACK=true RR_SMOKE_DOMAIN=shop.example.com \
  deploy/ci/proxy-smoke.sh nginx
```

Then nothing is created or removed; the checks run against the deployment as it
is, and the `outside` and `inside` vantages still need the two networks the
overlay adds.

CI runs both profiles as a matrix on every pull request, and both have to be
green to merge.
